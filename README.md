### Project Overview
This repository serves as the primary technical workbench for the 2026 Cybersecurity Foundations course. It establishes a version-controlled environment for deploying network security configurations, cloud security assessments, and GRC compliance documentation.

### System Specifications
The following hardware and network metrics define the local environment for this technical baseline:

* **Operating System:** Windows 11 Pro (64-bit)
* **System Memory (RAM):** 32 GB DDR4
* **Graphics Memory (VRAM):** 12 GB Dedicated GDDR6
* **Network Throughput:** 929.78 Mbps Download / 932.00 Mbps Upload (Symmetric Fiber-Optic Baseline)

### I. Executive Summary
*Briefly describe the purpose of this lab (e.g., identifying insecure protocols or mapping the OSI model).*

### II. The OSI Model Application
| Layer | Name | Protocol/Data Observed | Security Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 7** | Application | | |
| **Layer 4** | Transport | | |
| **Layer 3** | Network | | |
| **Layer 2** | Data Link | | |

### III. Technical Findings & Metrics
> **Practitioner Note:** Replace vague observations with exact metrics (e.g., "Latency: 22ms" or "TTL: 64").

* **Observation 1:**
